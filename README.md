# DESCRIPTION
In this task, we created a Java program to perform basic file handling operations such as reading, writing, and modifying text files. The program creates a file, writes data into it, reads the stored data, and updates the file content. Java I/O classes like FileWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader were used to handle file operations efficiently. This demonstrates how Java manages data storage using text files.
